## Our Privacy Policy: Casual Raffu

This is our app, Smithing Smith. The app uses Unity and it is currently placed in the Google Play Store.
It is not an open source app, the code resides with us. But it does not have any dangerous code in the sense that it will not take any information whatsoever.
This means that we will not be taking any of your privacy when you use one of our apps. We however, may use the analytics that Google provides for understanding what devices our population of players is using and so on.
And the way in which our app handles the storing of data is not through the cloud but through the use of a serialized data structure between the game's files.
Only within your own device and nowhere aside from there. Which means that there will not be any danger even if someone were to place malicious code in it.
Furthermore, the ad plugin and thus what is shown in your screen is owned by Unity Ads, I did not intend for this game to be for 13 years old or less, my target audience is everyone below their thirties.

If you have questions about my app and its data storing structure or about the ads then please contact me at this gmail:

Sincerely,
Casual Raffu.
